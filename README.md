ðŸš§ Oh, hello there! So you stumbled upon `bg-sound`, huh?

Well, I should probably address the quirks and known issues. Since it's just me tinkering away, things can get interesting. Here's what you should know:

Known issues:
- The visualizer widget? It's like modern art. Hard to understand and doesn't quite work as intended.
- Volume control? Mind of its own. It's an adventure trying to get it to behave.
- Oh, and the background sound? Doesn't actively change while the application is running. Because _Consistency is key around here._

But hey, if you're feeling up to the challenge, I won't stop you. Consider it a solo mission! And if you manage to fix something, I'll be eternally grateful.

Your contributions are always welcome! So, if you're up for it, check out the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/spmfte/BG-Sounds/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Now, I can't promise that everything will go smoothly, in fact I anticipate quite the opposite. I appreciate all and any future support, feedback, and contributions in making this project less quirky and more awesome.

If you encounter any additional quirks or just want to share your thoughts, [open an issue](https://github.com/spmfte/bg-sound/issues) or reach out to me.
